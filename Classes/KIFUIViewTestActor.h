#pragma mark - Searching for Accessibility Elements
/*!
 These methods are used to build the tester's search predicate. they are intended to be chained together allowing for complex searches.
 You can also build constructor methods which return view testers configured to find a specific element.
 Example:
 
 - (KIFUiViewTestActor)saveButton {
    return [[[viewTester usingLabel:@"Save"] usingTraits:UIAccessibilityTraitButton] usingIdentifier:@"exampleSaveButton"];
 }
 
 ... later ...
 
 [self.saveButton tap];
 [self.saveButton waitForAbsenceOfView];

 Note that these methods do not perfom a search. The tester will only search for elements once the search predicate has been built and it recieves an action call.

In general you should use the factory steps that tap a view based on its accessibility label, but there are situations where it's not possible to access a view using accessibility mechanisms. This step is more lenient than the steps that use the accessibility label, and does not wait for any particular view to appear, or validate that the tapped view is enabled or has interaction enabled. Because this step doesn't doesn't validate that a view is present before tapping it, it's good practice to precede this step where possible with a -waitForViewWithAccessibilityLabel: with the label for another view that should appear on the same screen.
