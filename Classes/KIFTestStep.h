 @param ... A string describing what the failure was that occurred. This may be a format string with additional arguments.

 @abstract Tests a condition and returns a wait result if the condition isn't true.
 @discussion This is a useful macro for quickly evaluating conditions in a test step. If the condition is false then the current test step will be aborted with a wait result, indicating that it should be called again in the near future.
 @param condition The condition to test.
 @param error The NSError object to put the error string into. May be nil, but should usually be the error parameter from the test step execution block.
 @param ... A string describing why the step needs to wait. This is important since this reason will be considered the cause of a timeout error if the step requires waiting for too long. This may be a format string with additional arguments.

 @class KIFTestStep
 @abstract A step in a testing sequence.
 @discussion Steps are the most basic element of a test, and are added together to create the scenarios to be tested.
 
 Steps are the building blocks of scenarios, and should be very simple. A number of useful factory steps are provided for mimicking basic user interaction. These steps leverage the built in accessibility of iOS to find and interact with views. As such, the accessibility inspector needs to be enabled under Settings in the simulator for them to work.

/*!
 @property timeout
 @abstract The amount of time to try the step before assuming that it failed.
 @discussion The timeout comes into play if a step returns the KIFTestStepResultWait result. If the step returns this result such that the step has been called repeatedly for a time greater than the timeout, then the step is considered to have failed. Steps are assumed to be well-behaved, and the timeout will not interrupt a step if it is running synchronously for an extended period of time.
