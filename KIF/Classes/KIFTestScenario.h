 @class KIFTestScenario
 @abstract A single scenario to be tested.
 @discussion A scenario represents a small, but cohesive unit of testing that usually maps to an available user action, such as logging in, or sending a message. Scenarios are comprised of smaller steps (represented by KIFTestSteps) for discrete interactions, such as tapping a button.
 
   A convenient practice is to add a category on KIFTestScenario which includes factory methods to create the scenarios you want to test. This provides a useful identifier for each scenario via the method name (something like +scenarioToLogInSuccessfully), and also provides an organized place for your application-specific scenarios.
